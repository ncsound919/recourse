# Run-Level Results

This guide explains how checkpoint metrics aggregate into run-level summaries, enabling performance comparison and trend analysis across multiple problems and checkpoints.

## Introduction

After an agent completes a run (all problems and checkpoints), two summary files are generated at the run root:

1. **checkpoint_results.jsonl**: All checkpoint metrics in one flattened JSONL file (one line per checkpoint)
2. **result.json**: Aggregated statistics across all checkpoints and problems

**Hierarchy:**
```
Run Level (result.json)
  ├─ Problem 1 Level (aggregated from checkpoints)
  │   ├─ Checkpoint 1
  │   ├─ Checkpoint 2
  │   └─ ...
  └─ Problem 2 Level (aggregated from checkpoints)
      ├─ Checkpoint 1
      └─ ...
```

## checkpoint_results.jsonl

All checkpoint-level metrics are flattened into a single JSONL file at the run root. This enables efficient analysis and filtering.

### Format

One JSON object per line, one line per checkpoint across all problems.

### MetricStats Structure

Each numeric metric is aggregated using `MetricStats`:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `mean` | Average value across checkpoints |
| `stddev` | Standard deviation (variability) |
| `min` | Minimum value |
| `max` | Maximum value |
| `median` | Middle value (50th percentile) |
| `count` | Number of values aggregated |

**Example interpretation:**
```json
"cc_high_count": {
  "mean": 3.2,
  "stddev": 1.5,
  "min": 0,
  "max": 7,
  "median": 3
}
```
Meaning: On average, 3.2 functions with CC > 10, ranging from 0 to 7, typically 3.

### Complete Structure Reference

**Top-level sections:**
- `model`, `thinking`, `prompt`, `agent_type`, `agent_version`: Configuration
- `num_problems`, `num_checkpoints`: Counts
- `costs`, `time`, `tokens`, `steps`: Efficiency metrics at checkpoint/problem levels
- `solve_rates`: Overall solution percentages
- `pass_rates`: Test pass rates by type
- `cc`: Complexity statistics
- `ratios`: Quality per unit code
- `delta`: Average changes between checkpoints
- `composite_scores`: High-level quality indicators

## Aggregation Logic

### Checkpoint-Level Statistics

Computed within each checkpoint from checkpoint_results.jsonl:
- `pass_rate`: (passed_tests / total_tests) * 100
- `core_pass_rate`: (core_passed / core_total) * 100
- Quality metrics: Direct from quality_analysis/

### Problem-Level Statistics

Aggregated across checkpoints for one problem:
- `mean_time`: Average elapsed time per checkpoint
- `total_cost`: Sum of costs across checkpoints
- `pct_solved`: (checkpoints_passed / total_checkpoints) * 100
- `cc_mean`: Mean of cc_mean across checkpoints
- Quality ratios: Aggregate violations / aggregate LOC

### Run-Level Statistics

Aggregated across all problems:
- All metrics computed as mean ± stddev across all problems
- `pct_checkpoints_solved`: (solved_checkpoints / total_checkpoints) * 100
- `pct_problems_solved`: (fully_solved_problems / total_problems) * 100
- `pct_problems_partial`: (partially_solved_problems / total_problems) * 100
- Total cost: Sum across entire run

### Composite Scores

**Verbosity Score**: Measures code bloat and over-abstraction.

**Formula:**
```
verbosity_per_checkpoint = verbosity_flagged_pct
```

Mean across all checkpoints = verbosity score

**Erosion Score**: Measures structural degradation

**Formula:**
```
erosion_per_checkpoint = mass.high_cc_pct
```

Mean across all checkpoints = erosion score

Higher scores indicate worse code health.

## Reading Run Results Programmatically

### Load RunSummary

```python
import json

with open('result.json', 'r') as f:
    summary = json.load(f)

# Overall performance
print(f"Problems solved: {summary['solve_rates']['pct_problems_solved']}%")
print(f"Total cost: ${summary['costs']['total']:.2f}")

# Average complexity
cc_mean = summary['cc']['cc_mean']
cc_high = summary['cc']['cc_high_count']['mean']
print(f"Average CC: {cc_mean:.1f}, High-CC functions: {cc_high:.1f}")
```

### Stream checkpoint_results.jsonl

```python
import json

with open('checkpoint_results.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        checkpoint = json.loads(line)
        print(f"{checkpoint['problem']} {checkpoint['checkpoint']}: "
              f"pass_rate={checkpoint['pass_rate']:.2%}, "
              f"cost=${checkpoint['cost']:.2f}")
```

### Filter by Problem

```python
import json

problem_name = 'circuit_eval'
checkpoints = []

with open('checkpoint_results.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        cp = json.loads(line)
        if cp['problem'] == problem_name:
            checkpoints.append(cp)

print(f"Problem '{problem_name}': {len(checkpoints)} checkpoints")
for cp in checkpoints:
    print(f"  {cp['checkpoint']}: {cp['core_pass_rate']:.0%} core pass")
```

### Compute Custom Aggregations

```python
import json
from statistics import mean, stdev

# Find average cost per LOC
costs_per_loc = []

with open('checkpoint_results.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        cp = json.loads(line)
        if cp['loc'] > 0:
            cost_per_loc = cp['cost'] / cp['loc']
            costs_per_loc.append(cost_per_loc)

print(f"Cost per LOC: {mean(costs_per_loc):.4f} ± {stdev(costs_per_loc):.4f}")
```

## Comparing Runs

### Compare Overall Performance

```python
import json

def compare_runs(run1_path, run2_path):
    def load_summary(path):
        with open(f'{path}/result.json') as f:
            return json.load(f)

    s1 = load_summary(run1_path)
    s2 = load_summary(run2_path)

    print("Metric                  | Run 1      | Run 2      | Change")
    print("-" * 60)
    print(f"Problems solved         | {s1['solve_rates']['pct_problems_solved']:6.1f}%  | {s2['solve_rates']['pct_problems_solved']:6.1f}%  | {s2['solve_rates']['pct_problems_solved'] - s1['solve_rates']['pct_problems_solved']:+6.1f}%")
    print(f"Total cost              | ${s1['costs']['total']:8.2f}  | ${s2['costs']['total']:8.2f}  | {((s2['costs']['total'] - s1['costs']['total']) / s1['costs']['total'] * 100):+6.1f}%")
    print(f"Avg checkpoint time     | {s1['time']['checkpoint']['mean']:8.1f}s | {s2['time']['checkpoint']['mean']:8.1f}s | {((s2['time']['checkpoint']['mean'] - s1['time']['checkpoint']['mean']) / s1['time']['checkpoint']['mean'] * 100):+6.1f}%")
    print(f"CC high count (mean)    | {s1['cc']['cc_high_count']['mean']:8.1f}  | {s2['cc']['cc_high_count']['mean']:8.1f}  | {s2['cc']['cc_high_count']['mean'] - s1['cc']['cc_high_count']['mean']:+6.1f}")
```

### Identify Problem Patterns

```python
import json

with open('checkpoint_results.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    problems = {}
    for line in f:
        cp = json.loads(line)
        problem = cp['problem']
        if problem not in problems:
            problems[problem] = []
        problems[problem].append(cp)

# Find most expensive problem
for problem, checkpoints in problems.items():
    total_cost = sum(cp['cost'] for cp in checkpoints)
    total_time = sum(cp['elapsed'] for cp in checkpoints)
    avg_cc_max = sum(cp['cc_max'] for cp in checkpoints) / len(checkpoints)
    print(f"{problem}: ${total_cost:.2f}, {total_time:.0f}s, avg CC max: {avg_cc_max:.1f}")
```

### Track Quality Trends

```python
import json

with open('checkpoint_results.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        cp = json.loads(line)
        # Look for degradation patterns
        if cp['delta.lint_errors'] and cp['delta.lint_errors'] > 50:
            print(f"WARNING: {cp['problem']} {cp['checkpoint']} "
                  f"lint errors increased {cp['delta.lint_errors']:.0f}%")
        if cp['cc_max'] > 30:
            print(f"WARNING: {cp['problem']} {cp['checkpoint']} "
                  f"very complex function detected (CC={cp['cc_max']})")
```

## Dashboard Integration

Run-level results are used by the SlopCodeBench dashboard for visualization:
- **Overview page**: Shows solve rates, costs, solve time distributions
- **Checkpoints page**: Time-series of checkpoint metrics across problems
- **Quality page**: Complexity and code quality trends
- **Efficiency page**: Cost, time, token utilization per problem

See dashboard documentation for visualization details.

## Troubleshooting

**Missing checkpoint_results.jsonl?**
- Generated after first checkpoint completes
- Check that run completed without crashing

**Unexpected aggregated values?**
- Verify all checkpoints have quality_analysis/ directories
- Check that evaluation.json exists for each checkpoint

**Delta metrics showing 'inf'?**
- First checkpoint (no prior to compare against) will have inf deltas
- This is expected and can be filtered out if needed

See [Checkpoint Results](checkpoint-results.md) for checkpoint-level troubleshooting.
