"""Carry forward unchanged rubric grades across checkpoints.

This module provides functionality to identify grades from a previous checkpoint
that should be carried forward to the current checkpoint because the underlying
code hasn't changed. It uses diff information to:

1. Parse unified diff hunks to understand which regions changed
2. Calculate new line offsets for unchanged regions
3. Identify grades that weren't re-flagged but should persist
4. Return carried-forward grades with adjusted line numbers

Example:
    >>> prev_grades = [{"criteria": "overdoc", "start": 50, "end": 51, ...}]
    >>> new_grades = []
    >>> diff_text = "@@ -78,6 +80,269 @@\\n+new lines..."
    >>> carried = carry_forward_grades(
    ...     prev_grades, new_grades, diff_text, "main.py", "checkpoint_1"
    ... )
    >>> # Grade at line 50 is before the hunk, so it's unchanged
